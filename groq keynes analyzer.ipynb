However, the uncertainty and animal spirits that often accompany natural disasters and economic fluctuations may also lead to increased liquidity preference, as individuals and businesses become more cautious and hesitant to invest.

The government's decision to invest in new housing and infrastructure projects could provide a much-needed boost to aggregate demand, but it's crucial to balance this with prudent fiscal management to avoid exacerbating inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, the IEA's forecast of rising global electricity demand underscores the importance of investing in renewable energy sources and improving energy efficiency to mitigate the risks of climate change and ensure sustainable economic growth. As the Turkish economy navigates these complex challenges, policymakers must remain vigilant and adaptable, using a combination of fiscal and monetary tools to stabilize the economy and promote long-term prosperity."
